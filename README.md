Comparison of Classical and Deep Learning-Based Feature Representations for Age-Related Macular Degeneration [MICAD2024] (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-96-3863-5_46)

## Introduction

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness, particularly in individuals over 50. Detecting AMD early is crucial for slowing its progression. This report summarizes a study that compares classical feature extraction techniques and deep learning models for AMD detection using fundus images.

### Key Findings

- **Deep Learning Performance:** The fine-tuned RETFound model outperformed all classical methods, achieving the highest accuracy and AUC-ROC.
- **Classical Methods:** Despite being outperformed by deep learning, classical methods like LBP still achieved notable results, particularly in lower-resource scenarios.
- **Classifier Comparison:** Logistic Regression generally performed better than SVM across most feature sets.
